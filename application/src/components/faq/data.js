      answer: "First, upload a csv file containing a list of items and their dimensions: height, weight and depth. Next, the list of all the items will be presented. You can alter their dimensions, add new items and delete existing items. Afterwards select a container (notice that there are three pre-defined sizes and one custom container- all vary by size and price). Proceed to the last step, now a 3D representation of the container and the items (as boxes) will appear. You can move the container around and watch it from different angels. You can press one of the boxes and move it with your keyboard (move left, right, forward and backward). In the left will be a list of all items that were left out of the container. Pressing on one of the items in the list will pop a box with the item's dimensions. Above there will be another solution available. Lastly, press on the button to extract the final solution (to download a csv file of all the items that were placed in the container).",
